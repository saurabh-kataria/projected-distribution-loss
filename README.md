# projected-distribution-loss
My implementation of Projected Distribution Loss (PDL) proposed in:
Delbracio, Mauricio, Hossein Talebi, and Peyman Milanfar. "Projected Distribution Loss for Image Enhancement." arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.09289 (2020).
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09289]

There is also implementation of Sliced Wasserstein Loss. Very close to many other implementations on github.
Feedback will be appreciated.
